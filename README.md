# TCP_STACK_IN_Verilog
Here I have developed the axis_write module with testbench
Here I have also developed the axis_read module with testbench
Here I also developed the data buffer module with test bench

# The TCP packet builder is left  for building :
Problem statement : 
1) How to configure the src port , dest port at transport layer does we assigned randomly if  it is coming from
   externally then how it will assigned inside the TCP module.
2) We are building the packets so it means we need to set the sequence number and ack number manually ?
3) Also after build up the packet we are finding the checksum for error detection and do  we are focussing on to develop the CRC check also ?
4) Or By developing the Checksum at TCP stack we will check our stack is working fine or data tranasfer to MAC . This all process will happened at TX side?
